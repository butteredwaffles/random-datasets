This dataset contains information on pokemon in the game Pokemon Quest for mobile and Nintendo Switch.
It's sourced straight from Serebii, so credit goes to them.

## A Couple of Notes
`pokemon.csv` contains all the pokemon information (wow) while each .csv under the `recipe` folder contains information on the chances to attract pokemon with a certain quality recipe.

In `pokemon.csv`, lists are separated by `/`. For example, the moves. For the stat ranges, the HP and attack are seperated by dashes (`-`) with the `/` separating the different pots. The order is `Brass / Bronze / Silver / Gold`.

In addition, the socket chances are percents out of 100. Thought it'd be easier just to leave them as floats.
